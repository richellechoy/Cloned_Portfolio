<p>The objective of this project was to design an interactive game that 
consisted of levels with varying difficulty that made players feel a sense of 
progression. My partner and I collectively agreed that it was appropriate to 
design the game based off a triathlon, in which three levels are dedicated to 
running, biking, and swimming respectively. As the player progresses 
further into the game, they will encounter more obstacles that will prevent
them from reaching the finish line. In order to be qualified to pass the
finish line, the player must collect three stars that are scattered
throughout the game. Because this game restarts from the beginning when
the player comes into contact with an obstacle, it encourages players
to apply their experiences from their mistakes to progress further in the 
game, thus developing their skill.</p>
